3W – Full Stack Internship Assignment
Task 1: Build a Mini Social Post Application
Objective:
 Create a simple social post feature where users can create accounts, post text or images, view posts from others, like, and comment — similar to the Social Page in the TaskPlanet app.
________________


Step 1 – Explore the Reference App
1. Download and open the TaskPlanet App from Play Store:
👉 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taskplanet

2. Go to the Social Page from the bottom navigation.

3. Take UI inspiration from that page and make your project look and feel similar.

________________


Step 2 – Features to Build
   1. Account Creation

      * Simple signup and login with email and password.

      * Store user details in the database (MongoDB).

         2. Create Post

            * A user can post text, image, or both.

            * Both fields should not be mandatory (either one is enough).

               3. Feed

                  * All posts from all users should be visible in a public feed.

                  * Display username, post content, likes, and comments count.

                     4. Like and Comment

                        * Other users should be able to like or comment on any post.

                        * Show total likes and comments.

                        * Save the usernames of people who liked or commented.

                           * Frontend: React.js

                           * Backend: Node.js + Express

                           * Database: MongoDB

                           * Styling Options (Choose any one or mix):

                              * Material UI (MUI)

                              * React Bootstrap

                              * Basic CSS

Step 4 – Project Guidelines
                                    * Keep your UI simple, clean, and inspired by the TaskPlanet social feed.

                                    * Use only two MongoDB collections — one for users and one for posts.

                                    * Ensure basic authentication flow (signup → login → create post → view feed).

                                    * Make sure like and comment updates reflect instantly in the UI.
